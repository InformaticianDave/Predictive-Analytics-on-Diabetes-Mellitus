Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is one of the major metabolic syndromes, which causes a person’s body to either 
produce low insulin or become insensitive to insulin [1]. There are two types of diabetes, but the one that 
we will be focusing on in this project is DM Type 2, which is a genetic condition and is mostly related to 
low production of insulin [1]. Type II DM is related to insulin insensitivity acquired mostly due to obesity 
and sedentary lifestyle. It has been widespread in developing countries in recent years, posing a greater 
hazard to individuals in the latter than in the former [2].

According to the latest statistics on Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2020 about 34.2 million 
Americans live with diabetes [3]. This amounts to about 10.5% of the US population [3]. Out of the 
approximately 34.2 million plus individuals with diabetes, 26.9 million were diagnosed and 7.3 million 
people went undiagnosed [3]. Each year according to ADA.org, 1.5 million new cases are identified [4]. 
However, the most staggering statistics as per the ADA, from 2015 monitoring is that adults over the age 
of 18 years who have no idea they are diabetic...the numbers are 88 million people who are considered 
prediabetic and therefore have no reason to seek treatment because of their undiagnosed or 
unbeknownst condition [4]. Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States back in 2017 
based on analysis from ADA officials [4,5]. The numbers keep staggering, as the projected cost of 
diabetes in America is $327 billion which is attained to the cost of diagnosed diabetes in individuals from 
2017 [4].

By 2035, the number of individuals living with diabetes is predicted to reach 592 million [6]. Despite its 
fatality, Type II is preventable and can be predicted based on certain characteristics. If we can predict DM 
type 2 at an earlier stage, the patient will not have such adverse effects nor high medical bills in there 
near future. That’s why our project is focus.

The random forest algorithm creates numerous decision trees and blends them together, producing a more 
accurate and reliable prediction. The accuracy attained is statistically significant. Decision boundaries can be 
ascertained by splitting the data set to more manageable components.

With the rate at which diabetes is becoming more prevalent among people, it is critical to recognize diabetes at 
an early stage. This study demonstrates the value of machine learning in the healthcare business for 
decision-making and lowering diagnostic costs. The work's key contribution is the development of a novel 
optimum model for forecasting diabetes in its early stages, as well as the emphasis on exploratory data analysis 
and data processing. 

It would be fascinating to see. Future study will see if family history, environmental factors, the presence of 
harmful immune system cells (autoantibodies), and geography may be included in the dataset to see what effect 
these variables have in the identification of diabetes.

Further the narrative of confronting the conundrum of successfully highlighting and predicting diabetes. 
Moreover, in particularly how to help epidemiologist correctly evaluate a population which has unknown history 
could prove to be extremely important in the medical arena moving forward.
